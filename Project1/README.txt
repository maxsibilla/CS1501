Usage: java ComputeDistanceBetween [txt file] [txt file]

This assignment compares the difference two text files as the angle between their vectors. This is done by tokenizing every word in each file, adding it to a TreeMap, and then computing the summation of their vectors and the angle between them. We define a word as being a consecutive alpha-numeric grouping while ignoring punctuation.
