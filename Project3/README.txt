Usage: java Solver [puzzle txt file]

We were tasked to create a solver of the 8puzzle problem using an A* algorithm. It is capable of utilizing the Manhattan and Hamming priority functions for a best-first search. The default is Manhattan priority and in order to use Hamming priority, you only need to comment out a portion of code in SearchNode.java. The displaying boards will be in descending order, with the original board at the bottom of the output.
